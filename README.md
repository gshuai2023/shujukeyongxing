dataset:
The experiment in this paper uses the UA-DETRAC public dataset as a vehicle detection dataset. The UA-DETRAC dataset is a large open-source dataset for multi-vehicle detection and tracking. The dataset is derived from 24 real road video surveillance data in Beijing and Tianjin, covering a variety of weather conditions such as sunny days, rainy days, cloudy days, and nighttime. The vehicles are classified in the dataset, including cars, buses, trucks, and other categories. A total of 8,250 vehicles are marked, generating 1.21 million labels.
Since the differences between most adjacent frames in the UA-DETRAC dataset are not obvious, data redundancy occurs. To solve this problem, we extract 1 frame every 10 frames and finally obtain about 13,824 images. Then, 11,000 images with dense vehicles and complex backgrounds are selected to ensure the diversity and challenge of the data. The dataset is divided into training set, validation set, and test set in a ratio of 7:2:1. This processing method significantly reduces data redundancy and training time, while effectively avoiding overfitting. By selecting complex images and reasonably dividing the dataset, the training effect and generalization ability of the model are improved.
